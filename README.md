# üèπRobinHood
RobinHood (shortened RH) is a file synchronisation application that provides a [FreeFileSync](https://freefilesync.org/)-inspired front-end to [``rclone``](https://rclone.org/).

**This application is still a work-in-progress** and is currently not available through PIP. You are welcome to download and use it (please read carefully licence and disclaimer).

## üì•Installation
Python >=3.10 is required to run this application. Furthermore, the following packages are required:
- textual==0.38.1
- psutil==5.9.5
- platformdirs==3.11.0
- aiofiles==23.2.1
- bigtree[pandas]==0.14.3

They can be easily installed by running

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

I also made a specific library to interact with ``rclone``. As this is not currently available with PIP, it needs to be downloaded. By cloning this repository, it should also add ``pyrclone`` library from the other repository. However, if anything goes bad, please also clone the following repository: https://github.com/valerio-afk/pyrclone

## üèÉQuick Start

    $ python rh.py

## üë•Profiles
It is highly recommended the creation of profiles to keep track of source and destination paths, file/path filters, and much more. This can be done via command line (``python rh.py profile --help``) or via the user interface (``CTRL+P`` allows you to save the current configurations).

To open RH with your profile, simply write

    $ python rh.py <method> -p <your_profile>
where method can be one of the following:
- ``update:`` to transfer new files from source to destination
- ``mirror:`` to make destination *exactly* as the source
- ``synch:`` bi-directional synching
- ``dedupe:`` to identify deduplicates

These actions will not be performed and you can change it once the user interface appears.
